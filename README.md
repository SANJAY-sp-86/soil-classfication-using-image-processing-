**Soil Classification Using Image Processing**

![Soil Classification](image_soil_classification.jpg)

This repository contains code and resources for soil classification using image processing techniques. The aim of this project is to classify different types of soil based on images using machine learning and computer vision algorithms.

### How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: We gather a dataset of soil images containing different types of soil samples.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images undergo preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and noise reduction to enhance their quality and make them suitable for analysis.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from the images using techniques like edge detection, color histograms, and texture analysis.
4. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained on the extracted features to classify soil types. Popular classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness.
6. **Deployment**: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed to classify soil types in real-world scenarios.
